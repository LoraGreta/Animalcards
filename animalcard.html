					Shires are considered the biggest of all draft (draught) breeds. The tallest horse in the world was a Shire and stood 7 foot 2 inches (21.6hh). The heaviest Shire was 3,300 lbs, but the average weight range is 850 to 1,100 lbs. They can be black, bay or grey. The UK Rare Breeds Survival Trust considers the Shire horse breed to be “at risk”. Whereas there were 1 million Shires at the turn of the century, there are only 1,500 in the world now and they are rarer than the Giant Panda.
